# VVVVVV 1.0.1-alpha

An attempt to port of VVVVVV to the Windows 10 Phone via UWP. Proto / Proof-of-concept

My goal was to RnD (explore, re-learn foggoten...) some C++ features and SDL2(_mixer) libs "montage"...

## Whats new?
- Experimental touchscreen&mouse game input realized (in addition to keyboard input)

## Build instructions
You are able to build through Visual Studio 2022 (but only x64 is currently tested... howover, min os build 15063.. so, ARM may be ok...) 

## Bugs
- It crash for me in Windows 10 Mobile (on real Lumia 950)
